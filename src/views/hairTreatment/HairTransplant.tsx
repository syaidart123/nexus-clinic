    {
      q: "How much does a hair transplant cost in Malaysia?",
      a: "Most clinics price based on grafts and method. Published ranges often start around the mid thousands in RM and can go much higher for larger sessions. Some KL providers list about RM 5,500 to RM 15,000 for many FUE cases, while others show ranges up to RM 30,000. A proper quote should follow an in-person assessment.",
    },
    {
      q: "Is a hair transplant painful?",
      a: "During the procedure, local anaesthesia is used, so sharp pain is not expected. You may still feel pressure or movement. After the procedure, the scalp can feel tight, achy, and swollen for a few days. Your clinic can guide safe pain relief and aftercare.",
    },
    {
      q: "How long does it take to recover from a hair transplant?",
      a: "Many people return to desk work within a few days, but visible healing takes longer. Clinics often advise avoiding heavy exercise for one to two weeks. Grafts tend to become more stable after about two weeks, so that early period matters a lot.",
    },
    {
      q: "When will I see full results?",
      a: "Hair transplant results are slow by design. You may see early growth by month three to six, then gradual thickening. Many guides for Malaysia timelines note full results often appear around 12 to 18 months.",
    },
    {
      q: "Is shedding after a hair transplant normal?",
      a: "Yes, shedding can happen and it often worries people. It is commonly linked to shock loss, where hair shafts shed while follicles rest before growing again. If shedding feels extreme or you see signs of infection, check with your clinic promptly.",
    },
    {
      q: "Is a hair transplant permanent?",
      a: "Transplanted follicles are usually taken from areas less affected by typical pattern hair loss. That is why results can be long-lasting. Still, native hair around the transplant can continue thinning, so some people need ongoing maintenance.",
    },
    {
      q: "How many grafts do I need?",
      a: "Graft count depends on your hair loss pattern, your donor density, and how dense you want the result to look. Some clinics provide sample ranges like 1,000, 2,000, or 3,000 plus graft plans, but only an assessment can confirm what is realistic for you.",
    },
    {
      q: "What is better, FUE or FUT?",
      a: "FUE is popular because it avoids a long strip scar and healing is often easier. FUT can be useful for some cases that need many grafts. The better option is the one that fits your donor area, hairstyle preference, and long-term plan.",
    },
    {
      q: "What side effects should I expect?",
      a: "Common short-term effects include swelling, tightness, and scabbing. Scarring can occur, but it varies by method and individual healing. Like any procedure, there is also a risk of infection, so hygiene and aftercare matter.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can a hair transplant fail?",
      a: "Most grafts survive when the plan is good and aftercare is followed, but outcomes can vary. Risk factors include poor donor selection, smoking, uncontrolled health issues, and poor post-op care. Your clinic should screen for these risks before treatment.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can women get a hair transplant in Malaysia?",
      a: "Yes, women can get hair transplants in Malaysia. The approach may differ from men's treatments, as female pattern hair loss often involves diffuse thinning rather than distinct bald areas. A thorough assessment is needed to determine if you're a suitable candidate.",

                A hair transplant moves your own hair follicles from a fuller
                area to a thinner area. Most donor hair comes from the back or
                sides of your scalp.

                The goal is not "maximum hair." The goal is a natural hairline,
                good coverage, and a plan that ages well.
