            <p className="text-taupe mb-4">
              Some people lose hair slowly over years. Some people shed suddenly
              after stress, illness, weight loss, or low iron. Some people get
              patchy hair loss that comes and goes.

                  Finasteride is used for male pattern hair loss but can have

                  When follicles are no longer active in an area, a transplant
                  may be considered. Many Malaysia sources cite typical
                  transplant cost ranges around RM 6,000 to RM 15,000 depending
                  on grafts.

                  PRP session pricing is commonly listed in the hundreds to a
                  few thousand RM per session. Transplant costs are usually
                  higher and depend on grafts. The right number depends on your
                  plan.
